## AP Computer Science A Units
In this section, I will talk about what I learn in each unit of my AP CS A class to better understand the topics.

### Unit 1: Primitive Types
As an AP CS A class, we learned this unit from our instructor Sedat Yalcin and by watching videos in the College Board AP Computer Science Page. The unit taught us the basics of Java, which is the coding language that AP CS A uses. It contains five subtopics, and I will summarize them here to show what I learn in this class and to express what I learned in my own words. 

#### 1.1 Why Programming? Why Java?
In this subtopic, I learned some error types and basic commands. Here are some points that I learned: 
* Block comments are used to list some important information, such as the programmer, the date, and the purpose of the code, about the following codes. They are texts that are put between "/*" and "*/". The compiler ignores them.
* The main method controls all the following code. I learned "public static void main(String[] args)" as a main method, but there are different ones as well.
* "System.out.print" displays whatever is intended to be compiled but does not pass to the next line.
* "System.out.println" displays whatever is intended to be compiled and passes to the next line.
* The intended text to be printed by these commands between quotation marks is called the string literal.
* There are three error types:
  1. Syntax/Compile Errors: Errors due to syntax (the rules of the coding language), which prevents the compiler from running the code. For example, coding "system.out.print" instead of using a capital "S" in "System" ("System.out.print").
  2. Exceptions: The errors that cause the program to terminate abnormally. For example, trying to divide a number by 0.
  3. Logic Errors: The errors that occur when the actual output is not the same as the intended output. For example, the programmer might accidentally divide 8 by 2 instead of multiplying them as they intended.
  4.
