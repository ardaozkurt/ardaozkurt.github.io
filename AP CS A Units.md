## AP Computer Science A Units
In this section, I will talk about what I learn in each unit of my AP CS A class to better understand the topics.
### Unit 1: Primitive Types
As an AP CS A class, we learned this unit from our instructor Sedat Yalcin and by watching videos in the College Board AP Computer Science Page. The unit taught us the basics of Java, which is the coding language that AP CS A uses. It contains five subtopics, and I will summarize them here to show what I learn in this class and to express what I learned in my own words.
