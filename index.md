## AP Computer Science A Units
In this section, I will talk about what I learn in each unit of my AP CS A class to better understand the topics.

### Unit 1: Primitive Types
As an AP CS A class, we learned this unit from our instructor Sedat Yalcin and by watching videos in the College Board AP Computer Science Page. The unit taught us the basics of Java, which is the coding language that AP CS A uses. It contains five subtopics, and I will summarize them here to show what I learn in this class and to express what I learned in my own words. 

#### 1.1 Why Programming? Why Java?
In this subtopic, I learned some error types and basic commands. Here are some points that I learned: 
* Block comments are used to list some important information, such as the programmer, the date, and the purpose of the code, about the following codes. They are texts that are put between "/*" and "*/". The compiler ignores them.
* The main method controls all the following code. I learned "public static void main(String[] args)" as a main method, but there are different ones as well.
* "System.out.print" displays whatever is intended to be compiled but does not pass to the next line.
* "System.out.println" displays whatever is intended to be compiled and passes to the next line.
* The intended text to be printed by these commands between quotation marks is called the string literal.
* There are three error types:
  1. Syntax/Compile Errors: Errors due to syntax (the rules of the coding language), which prevents the compiler from running the code. For example, coding "system.out.print" instead of using a capital "S" in "System" ("System.out.print").
  2. Exceptions: The errors that cause the program to terminate abnormally. For example, trying to divide a number by 0.
  3. Logic Errors: The errors that occur when the actual output is not the same as the intended output. For example, the programmer might accidentally divide 8 by 2 instead of multiplying them as they intended.

## About Me

Hello! I am Arda Ozkurt, a senior at Hisar High School in Istanbul, Turkey. In my free time, I enjoy playing piano and chess. I am the leader of the cybersecurity club in my school, and each year, we teach WIFI-cracking, virtualization, operating systems, and many other fascinating cybersecurity topics to middle school and high school students at annual summits. I am also interested in neuroscience and lead the neuroscience club of our school. We translate the content of the Knowing Neurons [webpage](https://knowingneurons.com/turkish-translation-project/), a popular neuroscience website, into Turkish to spread neuroscience to a Turkish audience. In this personal webpage, I will share my projects.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
