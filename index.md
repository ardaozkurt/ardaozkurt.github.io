# About Me

Hello! I am Arda Ozkurt, a senior at Hisar High School in Istanbul, Turkey. In my free time, I enjoy playing piano and chess. I am the leader of the cybersecurity club in my school, and each year, we teach WIFI-cracking, virtualization, operating systems, and many other fascinating cybersecurity topics to middle school and high school students at annual summits. I am also interested in neuroscience and lead the neuroscience club of our school. We translate the content of the Knowing Neurons webpage, a popular neuroscience website, into Turkish to spread neuroscience to a Turkish audience. In this personal webpage, I will share my projects.
